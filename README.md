Serenity, a revolutionary initiative dedicated to supporting new parents, recognizes that up to 4 out of 5 parents (approximately 80%) experience baby blues. This condition can affect new parents from diverse backgroundsâ€”race, age, income level, culture, or educational attainment. The emotional journey post-childbirth, often referred to as 'Baby Blues Syndrome,' is not to be taken lightly. The heightened sensitivity during this phase can serve as a gateway to more serious issues like Postpartum Depression or Postpartum Distress Syndrome. It's not just about momentary sadness; these are symptoms that can evolve into disruptive anxiety and persistent emotional distress, impacting the overall well-being of parents both emotionally and physically. Serenity steps in to tackle these challenges with innovative solutions: nurturing quality sleep, maintaining health, and addressing the root causes of depression. We understand this emotional journey and are committed to assisting parents in navigating their roles with balance and tranquility.</p>
